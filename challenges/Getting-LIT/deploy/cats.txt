Jellicle songs for Jellicle cats
We can dive through the air like a flying trapeze
We can turn double somersaults, bounce on a tire
We can run up a wall, we can swing through the trees

Can you sing at the same time in more than one key?
Duets by Rossini and waltzes by Strauss?
And can you as cats do begin with a 'C'?
That always triumphantly brings down the house?
Jellicle cats are queen of the nights
Singing at astronomical heights
Handling pieces from the 'Messiah'
Hallelujah, angelical Choir
The mystical divinity of unashamed felinity
Round the cathedral rang 'Vivat'
Life to the everlasting cat!
Feline, fearless, faithful and true
To others who do what
Jellicles do and Jellicles can
Jellicles can and Jellicles do
Jellicle cats sing Jellicle chants
Jellicles old and Jellicles new

Statistical cats and mystical cats
Political cats, hypocritical cats
Clerical cats, hysterical cats
Cynical cats, rabbinical cats

ASPARAGUS
There's a man over there with a look of surprise
As much as to say well now how about that?
MUNKUSTRAP
Do I actually see with my own very eyes
A man who's not heard of a Jellicle cat?
What's a Jellicle cat?
COMPANY
What's a Jellicle cat?
THE NAMING OF CATS
COMPANY
The naming of cats is a difficult matter
It isn't just one of your holiday games
You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter
When I tell you a cat must have three different names
First of all, there's the name that the family use daily
Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey
All of them are sensible, everyday names
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
Some for the gentleman, some for the dames,
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter,
But all of them sensible everyday names.
But I tell you a cat needs a name that's particular
A name that's peculiar and more dignified
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular?
Or spread out his whiskers or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum
Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo or Coricopat
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum
Names that never belong to more than one cat
But above and beyond there's still one name left over
And that is the name that you will never guess
The name that no human research can discover
But the cat himself knows and will never confess
When you notice a cat in profound meditation
The reason, I tell you, is always the same
His mind is engaged in rapt contemplation
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name
His ineffable, effable, effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular name
Name, name, name, name, name, name
THE INVITATION TO THE JELLICLE BALL
MUNUSTRAP
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one, come all
The Jellicle moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
COMPANY
Jellicle cats come out tonight

Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one, come all
The Jellicle moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
MUNUSTRAP
Jellicle cats meet once a year
At the Jellicle ball where we all rejoice
And the Jellicle leader will soon appear
And make what is known as the Jellicle choice
When Old Deuteronomy just before dawn
Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to different Jellicle life
Because waiting up there is the Heaviside layer
With wonders one Jellicle only will see
Jellicles ask because Jellicles dare
Who will it be?
COMPANY
Who will it be?
THE OLD GUMBIE CAT
MUNUSTRAP
I have a Gumbie Cat in mind, her name is Jennyanydots
Her coat is of the tabby kind with tiger stripes and leopard spots
MATHEW = All day she sits beneath the stairs or on the steps or on the mat
BOTH 足 She sits and sits and sits and sits and that's what makes a Gumbie
Cat
TRIO (DEMTER, BOMBALURINA, JELLYLORUM)
But when the day's hustle and bustle is done
Then the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun
And when all the family's in bed and asleep
She tucks up her skirts to the basement to creep
She is deeply concerned with the ways of the mice
JENNYANYDOTS
Their behaviour's not good and their manners not nice
TRIO12
So when she has got them lined up on the matting
She teaches them Music, crocheting and tatting
MUNUSTRAP
I have a Gumbie Cat in mind, her name is Jennyanydots
The curtain cord she likes to wind and tie it into sailor knots
MAT 足 She sits upon the window sill or anything that's smooth and flat
BOTH 足 She sits and sits and sits and sits and that's what makes a Gumbie
Cat
TRIO12
But when the day's hustle and bustle is done
Then the Gumbie cat's work is but hardly begun
She thinks that the
JENNYANYDOTS
Cockroaches need employment
To prevent them from idle and wanton destroyment
TRIO12
So she's formed from that lot of disorderly louts
A troop of well disciplined helpful boy scouts
JENNYANYDOTS
With a purpose in life and a good deed to do
TRIO12
And she's even created a beetles tattoo!
COMPANY
For she's a jolly good fellow!
JENNYANYDOTS
Thank you my dears!
THE RUM TUM TUGGER
COMPANY
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
TUGGER
If you offer me pheasant, I'd rather have grouse
If you put me in a house, I would much prefer a flat
If you put me in a flat, I would rather have a house
If you set me on a mouse, then I only want a rat
If you set me on a rat, then I'd rather chase a mouse
COMPANY
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
TUGGER
And there isn't any need for me to shout it
COMPANY
For he will do as he do do
TUGGER
And there's nothing doing about it
MISTOFFOLEES
The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore
TUGGER
When you let me in, then I want to go out
I'm always on the wrong side of every door
And as soon as I'm at home, then I'd like to get about
I like to lie in the bureau drawer
But I make such a fuss if I can't get out
COMPANY
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
TUGGER
And there isn't any need for me to shout it
COMPANY
For he will do as he do do
TUGGER
And there's nothing doing about it
COMPANY
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious beast
TUGGER
My disobliging ways are a matter of habit
If you offer me fish, then I always want a feast
When there isn't any fish, then I won't eat rabbit
If you offer me cream, then I sniff and sneer
For I only like what I find for myself
So you'll catch me in it right up to my ears
If you put it away on the larder shelf
The Rum Tum Tugger is artful and knowing
The Rum Tum Tugger doesn't care for a cuddle
But I'll leap upon your lap in the middle of your sewing
For there's nothing I enjoy like a horrible muddle!

GRIZABELLA THE GLAMOUR CAT
GRIZABELLA
Remark the cat who hesitates toward you
In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin
You see the border of her coat is torn and stained with sand
And you see the corner of her eye twist like a crooked pin
DEMETER
She haunted many a low resort
Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the No Man's Land
From "The Rising Sun" to "The Friend at Hand"
And the postman sighed as he scratched his head
"You really had thought she'd ought to be dead
And who would ever suppose that that
Was Grizabella, the Glamour Cat?"
BOMBALURINA
Grizabella, the Glamour Cat
BOMBALURINA & DEMETER
Grizabella, the Glamour Cat
COMPANY
Who' would ever suppose that that
Was Grizabella the Glamour Cat?
BUSTOPHER JONES
JENNYANYDOTS
Bustopher Jones is not skin and bones
BOMBALURINA
In fact, he's remarkably fat
JELLYLORUM
He doesn't haunt pubs
JENNYANYDOTS
He has eight or nine clubs
ALL THREE
For he's the St. James Street cat!
JENNYANYDOTS
He's the cat we all greet as he walks down the street
In his coat of fastidious black
BOMBALURINA
No common足place mousers have such well足cut trousers
JELLYLORUM
Or such an impeccable back
COMPANY
In the whole of St. James's the smartest of names is
The name of this Brummell of cats
And we're all of us proud to be nodded or bowed to
By Bustopher Jones in white spats
BUSTOPHER JONES
My visits are occasional to the Senior Educational
And it is against the rules
For any one cat to belong both to that
And the Joint Superior Schools
When I'm seen in a hurry there's probably curry
At the Siamese or at the Glutton
If I look full of gloom then
I've lunched at the Tomb
On cabbage, rice pudding and mutton
COMPANY
In the whole of St. James's the smartest of names is
The name of this Brummell of cats
And we're all of us proud to be nodded or bowed to
By Bustopher Jones in white spats
JENNYANYDOTS
So much in this way passes Bustopher's day
At one club or another he's found
It can be no surprise that under our eyes
He has grown unmistakably round
He's a twenty足five pounder
BUSTOPHER JONES
Or I am a bounder
JENNYANYDOTS
And he's putting on weight every day
BUSTOPHER JONES
But I'm so well preserved because I've observed
All my life a routine and I'd say
I am still in my prime, I shall last out my time
JENNYANYDOTS
That's the word from this stoutest of cats
COMPANY
It must and it shall be spring in Pall Mall
While Bustopher Jones wears white,
Bustopher Jones wears white,
Bustopher Jones wears white spats
DEMETER
Macavity!
MUNGOJERRIE AND RUMPLETEAZER
MUNGOJERRIE
Mungojerrie
RUMPLETAZER
And Rumpelteazer
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
We're a notorious couple of cats
As knockabout clowns, quick change comedians
Tight足rope walkers and acrobats
MUNGOJERRIE
We have an extensive reputation
We make our home in Victoria Grove
That is merely our centre of operation
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
For we are incurably given to rove
MUNGOMATES
If the area window is found ajar
Or the basement looks like a field of war
If a tile or two comes loose on the roof
Which presently fails to be waterproof
MUNGOJERRIE
If the drawers are pulled out from bedroom chests
And you can't find one of your winter vests
RUMPLES CHUMS
If after supper one of the girls
Suddenly misses her Woolworth pearls
ALL
Then the family will say,
"It's that horrible cat!
MUNGOJERRIE
"Was it Mungojerrie
RUMPLETEAZER
Or Rumpelteazer!"
ALL
And most of the time they leave it at that
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer have a very unusual gift of the gab
RUMPLETEAZER
We are highly efficient cat burglars as well
And remarkably smart at the smash and grab
MUNGOJERRIE
We make our home in Victoria Grove
We have no regular occupation
We are plausible fellows who like to engage
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
A friendly policeman in conversation
When the family assembles for Sunday dinner
Their minds made up that they won't get thinner
On Argentine joint, Potatoes and greens
Then the cook will appear from behind the scenes
And say in a voice that is broken with sorrow
"I'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow
For the joint has gone from the oven like that!"
Then the family will say,
"It's that horrible cat!
MUNGOJERRIE
"Was it Mungojerrie
RUMPLETEAZER
Or Rumpelteazer!"
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
And most of the time they leave it at that
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer have a wonderful way
Of working together
And some of the time you would say it was luck
And some of the time you would say it was weather
We go through the house like a hurricane
And no sober person could take his oath
MUNGOJERRIE
Was it Mungojerrie?
RUMPLETEAZER
Or Rumpelteazer?
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
Or could you have sworn that it mightn't be both?
And when you hear a dining room smash
Or up from the pantry there comes a loud crash
Or down from the library there comes a loud ping
From a vase that was commonly said to be Ming
Then the family will say: "Now which was which cat?
MUNGOJERRIE
It was Mungojerrie
RUMPLETEAZER
And Rumpelteazer!"
MUNGOJERRIE & RUMPLETEAZER
And there's nothing at all to be done about that!
OLD DEUTERONOMY
TANTOMILE
I believe itis Old Deuteronomy.
COMPANY
Well of all things! Can it be, really!
Yes...No...Ho...Hi! Oh my eye!
My mind may be wandering but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy
MUNKUSTRAP
Old Deuteronomy's lived a long time
He's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
A long while before Queen Victoria's accession
TUGGER
Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more I am tempted to say ninety足nine
And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline
MUNKUSTRAP
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall
The oldest inhabitant croaks,
MUNKUSTRAP & TUGGER
Well of all things! Can it be, really!
Yes...No...Ho...Hi! Oh my eye!
My mind may be wandering but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy
ASPARAGUS
Old Deuteronomy sits in the street
He sits in the High Street on market day
The Bullocks may bellow, the sheep they may bleat
But the dogs and the herdsmen will turn them away
ASPARAGUS & MUNKUSTRAP
The cars and the lorries run over the curb
And the villagers put up a notice: "Road Closed"
So that nothing untoward may chance to disturb
Deuteronomy's rest when he feels so disposed
The digestive repose of that feline's gastronomy
Must never be broken, whatever befall
And the oldest inhabitant croaks,
COMPANY
Well of all things! Can it be, really!
Yes...No...Ho...Hi! Oh my eye!
My mind may be wandering but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy
Well of all things! Can it be, really!

My mind may be wandering but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy
Well of all things! Can it be, really!
Yes...No...Ho...Hi! Oh my eye!
DEUTERONOMY
My legs may be tottery, I must go slow
And be careful of Old Deuteronomy!
DEUTERONOMY
Pollicle dogs and cats all must
Jellicle cats and dogs all must
Like undertakers, come to dust
MUNKUSTRAP
Jellicle cats meet once a year
On the night when we make the Jellicle choice
And now that the Jellicle leader is here,
Jellicle Cats can all rejoice!
THE AWEFUL BATTLE OF THE PEKES AND THE POLLICLES
MUNKUSTRAP
Of the aweful battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles
Together with some account of the participation
Of the Pugs and the Poms
And the intervention of the Great Rumpus Cat
The Pekes and the Pollicles, as everyone knows.
Are proud and implacable passionate foes
It is always the same, wherever one goes
And the Pugs and the Poms, although most people say
That they do not like fighting, yet once in a way
They will now and again join in to the fray
And they
PEKES & POLLICLES
Bark bark bark bark
Bark bark BARK BARK!
MUNKUSTRAP
Until you can hear them all over the park
Now on the occasion of which I shall speak
Almost nothing had happened for nearly a week
And that's a long tome for a Pol or a Peke
The big Police Dog was away from his beat
I don't know the reason, but most people think
He'd slipped into the Wellington Arms for a drink
And no one at all was about on the street
When a Peke and a Pollicle happened to meet
They did not advance, or exactly retreat
But they glared at each other, and scraped their hind feet
And started to:
PEKES & POLLICLES
Bark bark bark bark
Bark bark BARK BARK!
MUNKUSTRAP
Until you could hear them all over the park
Now the Peke, although people may say what they please
Is no British Dog, but a heathen Chinese
And so all the Pekes, when they heard the uproar
Some came to the window, some came to the door
There were surely a dozen, more likely a score
And together they started to grumble and wheeze
In their huffery足snuffery heathen Chinese
But a terrible din is what Pollicles like
For your Pollicle Dog is a dour Yorkshire tyke
And is braw Scottish cousins are snappers and biters
And every dog足jack of them notable fighters
And so they stepped out, with their pipers in order
Playing When the Blue Bonnets Came Over the Border
Then the Pugs and the Poms held no longer aloof
But some from the balcony, some from the roof
Joined in to the din
With a
PEKES & POLLICLES
Bark bark bark bark
Bark bark BARK BARK!
MUNKUSTRAP
Until you could hear them all over the park
POLLICLES
There are dogs out of every nation
The Irish, the Welsh and the Dane
The Russian, the Dutch the Dalmatian
And even from China and Spain
The Poodle, the Pom, the Alsatian
And the mastiff who walks on a chain
MUNKUSTRAP
And to those that are frisky and frollical
Let my meaning be perfectly plain
POLLICLES
That my name it is Little Tom Pollicle
And you'd better not do it again
MUNKUSTRAP
Now when these bold heroes together assembled
The traffic all stopped, and the Underground trembled
And some of the neighbours were so much afraid
That they started to ring up the Fire Brigade
When suddenly, up from a small basement flat
Why who should stalk out but the Great Rumpus Cat!
His eyes were like fireballs fearfully blazing
He gave a great yawn, and his jaws were amazing
And when he looked through the bars of the area
You never saw anything fiercer or hairier
And what with the glare of his eyes and his yawning
The Pekes and the Pollicles quickly took warning
He looked at the sky and he gave a great leap
And they every last one of them scattered like sheep
And when the Police Dog returned to his beat,
There wasn't a single one left in the street

MEMORY
JELLYLORUM
You see the border of her coat is torn
And stained with sand
SILLABUB
You see the corner of her eye
Twist like a crooked pin
GRIZABELLA
Silence, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Every street lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Why Will the Summer Day Delay, When Will Time Flow
Away.
THE MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS
DEUTERONOMY
The moments of happiness
We had the experience but missed the meaning
And approach to the meaning restores the experience
In a different form beyond any meaning
We can assign to happiness
The past experience revived in the meaning
Is not the experience of one life only
But of many generations
Not forgetting something that is probably quite ineffable
MEMORY
SILLABUB
Moonlight, turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin

GUS, THE THEATRE CAT
JELLYLORUM
Gus is the cat at the theatre door
His name, as I ought to have told you before
Is really Asparagus, but that's a fuss to pronounce
That we usually call him just Gus
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
Yet he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
But no longer a terror to mice or to rats
For he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in his time
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days
For he once was a star of the highest degree
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree
And he likes to relate his success on the halls
Where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
But his greatest creation as he loves to tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell
ASPARAGUS
I have played in my time every possible part
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart
I'd extemporize back足chat, I knew how to gag
And I knew how to let the cat out of the bag
I knew how to act with my back and my tail
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
Whether I took the lead, or in character parts
I have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
When the curfew was rung then I swung on the bell
In the pantomime season, I never fell flat
And I once understudied Dick Whittington's cat
But my grandest creation, as history will tell
Was Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell
JELLYLORUM
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
When some actor suggested the need for a cat
ASPARAGUS
I say now these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned
They never get drilled in a regular troupe
And they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop
JELLYLORUM
And he says as he scratches himself with his claws:
ASPARAGUS
Well the theatre is certainly not what is was
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history
As Firefrorefiddle, the fiend of the fell
I once crossed the stage on the telegraph wire
To rescue a child when a house was on fire
And I think that I still can much better than most
Produce blood curdling noises to bring on the ghost
And I once played Growltiger
Could do it again, could do it again
Could do it again. . .
GROWLTIGER'S LAST STAND
PIRATES
Growltiger was a bravo cat who travelled on a barge
In fact he was the roughest cat that ever roamed at large
MUNKUSTRAP (as a PIRATE)
From Gravesend up to Oxford he pursued his evil aims
Rejoicing in his title of
GROWLTIGER (ASPARAGUS)
The "Terror of the Thames"! Ha ha ha ha!
TUGGER (as a PIRATE)
His manners and appearance did not calculate to please
His coat was torn and seedy, it was baggy at the knees
SKIMBLESHANKS (as a PIRATE)
One ear was somewhat missing, no need to tell you why
And he scowled upon a hostile world from one forbidding eye
PIRATES
The cottagers of Rotherhithe knew something of his fame
At Hammersmith and Putney, people shuddered at his name
ALONZO (as a PIRATE)
They would fortify the hen house, lock up the silly goose
PIRATES
When the rumour ran along the shore:
GROWLTIGER
Growltiger's on the loose! Ha ha ha ha!
MISTOFFOLESS (as a PIRATE)
Woe to the weak canary that fluttered from its cage
TUGGER
Woe to the pampered Pekinese, that faced Growltiger's rage
SKIMBLESHANKS
Woe the bristly bandicoot that lurks on foreign ships
MUNKUSTRAP
And woe to any cat with whom Growltiger came to grips
PIRATES
But most to cats of foreign race his hatred had been vowed
To cats of foreign name and race, no quarter was allowed
The Persian and the Siamese regarded him with fear
Because it was a Siamese had mauled his missing ear
Now on a peaceful summer night all nature seemed at play
The tender moon was shining bright, the barge at Molesey lay
All in the balmy moonlight it lay rocking on the tide
And Growltiger was disposed to show his sentimental side
GRIDDLEBONE (JELLYLORUM)
Chi e la?
GROWLTIGER
Mi amor!
GRIDDLEBONE
Sono qui
PIRATES
In the forepeak of the vessel, Growltiger sat alone
GROWLTIGER
Concentrating my attention on the lady Griddlebone
PIRATES
And his raffish crew were sleeping in their barrels and their bunks
As the Siamese came creeping in their sampans and their junks
GRIDDLEBONE
Growltiger had no eye or ear for aught but Griddlebone
GROWLTIGER
And the lady seemed enraptured by my manly baritone
GROWLTIGER & GRIDDLEBONE
Disposed to relaxation and awaiting no surprise
SIAMESE
But the moonlight shone reflected from a thousand bright blue eyes
And closer still and closer the sampans circled 'round
And yet from all the enemy there was not heard a sound
The foe was armed with toasting forks and cruel carving knives
And the lovers sang their last duet in danger of their lives
GROWLTIGER
In una tepida notte d'estate, allorche la natura
Era nel pieno filgore, e la fresca rugiada
Splendeva al chiar di luna sopra la veruza
Si poteva vedere il galeone ancorato
Oscillare in silenzio nel vento profumato
Dalla marea del naviglio serenemente cullato
In quella tepida notte che c'e dunque di male
Se intanta poesia il pirata divento sentimentale
GROWLTIGER & GRIDDLEBONE
Oscillare in silenzio nel vento profumato
Dalla marea del naviglio serenemente cullato
In quella tepida notte
In quella tepida notte
In quella tepida notte
GENGHIS
Then Genghis gave the signal to his fierce Mongolian hordes
With a frightful burst of fireworks, the chinks they swarmed aboard
Abandoning their sampans, their pullaways, and junks
They battened down the hatches on the crew within their bunks
Then Griddlebone she gave a screech for she was badly skeered
I'm sorry to admit it, but she quickly disappeared
GROWLTIGER
She probably escaped with ease I'm sure she was not drowned
SIAMESE
But a serried ring of flashing steel Growltiger did surround
The ruthless foe pressed forward in stubborn rank on rank
Growltiger to his vast surprise was forced to walk the plank
He who a hundred victims had driven to that drop
At the end of all his crimes was forced to go ker足flip, ker足flop!
GROWLTIGER
Ahhhhh!!!
SIAMESE
Oh there was joy in Wapping when the news flew through the land
At Maidenhead and Henley there was dancing on the Strand
Rats were roasted whole in Brentford and Victoria Dock
And a day of celebration was commanded in Bangkok!
ASPARAGUS
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history
SKIMBLESHANKS, THE RAILWAY CAT
DEUTERONOMY
Skimbleshanks the railway cat
COMPANY
The cat of the railway train
There's a whisper down the line at eleven thirty足nine
When the night mail's ready to depart
Saying,
"Skimble, where is Skimble has he gone to hunt the thimble
We must find him or the train can't start!"
All the guards and all the porters and the station足master's daughters
Would be searching high and low
Saying "Skimble, where is Skimble for unless he's very nimble
Then the night mail just can't go"
At eleven forty足two with the signal overdue
And the passengers all frantic to a man
SKIMBLESHANKS
That's when I would appear and I'd saunter to the rear
I'd been busy in the luggage van!
COMPANY
Then he gave one flash of his glass足green eyes
And the signal went "All clear!"
They'd be off at last for the northern part of the northern hemisphere!
Skimbleshanks, the railway cat
The cat of the railway train!
SKIMBLESHANKS
A 足 You might say that by and large it was me who was in charge
Of the sleeping car express
B 足 From the driver and the guards to the bagmen playing cards
I would supervise them all more or less
COMPANY
Down the corridor he paces and examines all the faces
Of the travellers in the first and the third
He establishes control by a regular patrol
And he'd know at once if anything occurred
He would watch you without winking and he saw what you were thinking
And it's certain that he didn't approve
Of hilarity and riot, so that folk were very quiet
When Skimble was about and on the move
You could play no pranks with Skimbleshanks
He's a cat that couldn't be ignored
So nothing went wrong on the northern mail
When Skimbleshanks was aboard
SKIMBLESHANKS
It was very pleasant when they'd found their little den
With their name written up on the door
And the berth was very neat with a newly folded sheet on
And not a speck of dust on the floor
There was every sort of light you could make it dark or bright
And a button you could turn to make a breeze
And a funny little basin you're supposed to wash your face in
And a crank to shut the window should you sneeze
Then the guard looked in politely and would ask you very brightly
"Do you like your morning tea
COMPANY
Weak or strong?"
SKIMBLESHANKS
A 足 But I just behind him and was ready to remind him
B 足 For Skimble won't let anything go wrong
COMPANY
When they crept into their cozy berth and pulled the counterpane
They ought to reflect that it was very nice
To know that they wouldn't be bothered by mice
They can leave all that to the railway cat
The cat of the railway train
Skimbleshanks, the railway cat
The cat of the railway train!
SKIMBLESHANKS
In the watches of the night I was always fresh and bright
Every now and then I'd have a cup of tea
With perhaps a drop of scotch while I was busy keeping on the watch
Only stopping here and there to catch a flea
They were fast asleep at Crewe
And so they never knew that I was walking up and down the station
They were sleeping all the while I was busy at Carlisle
Where I met the station足master with elation
They might see me at Dumfries if I summoned the police
If there was anything they ought to know about
COMPANY
When they got to Gallowgate there they did not have to wait
For Skimbleshanks will help them to get out
And he gives you a wave of his long brown tail
Which says,
"I'll see you again"
You'll meet without fail on the midnight mail
The cat of the railway train
You'll meet without fail on the midnight mail
The cat of the railway train
Skimbleshanks, the railway cat
The cat of the railway train!
DEMETER
Macavity!
MACAVITY
DEMETER
Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the hidden paw
For he's a master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
And when you reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air
But I tell you once and once again Macavity's not there!
BOMBALURINA
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined in thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half足asleep, he's always wide足awake!
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by足street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!
DEMETER
He's outwardly respectable
BOMBALURINA
I know he cheats at cards
DEMETER
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
BOMBALURINA
And when the larder's looted
DEMETER
Or the jewel case is rifled
BOMBALURINA
Or when the milk is missing
DEMETER
Or another Peke's been stifled
BOMBALURINA
Or the greenhouse glass is broken
DEMETER
And the trellis past repair
BOMBALURINA
There's the wonder of the thing: Macavity's not there!
DEMETER & BOMBALURINA
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place Macavity wasn't there!
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
DEMETER
I might mention Mungojerrie
BOMBALURINA
I might mention Griddlebone
DEMETER & BOMBALURINA
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls their operations: The Napoleon of Crime!
COMPANY
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by足street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered then Macavity
Macavity, Macavity, Macavity
When a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!
Macavity's not there!
MISTER MISTOFFOLEES
COMPANY
We have to find Old Deuteronomy
TUGGER
You ought to ask Mr. Mistoffelees
The original conjuring cat
There can be no doubt about that!
Please listen to me and don't scoff.
All his inventions are off his own bat
There's no such cat in the metropolis
He holds all the patent monopolies
For performing surprising illusions
And creating eccentric confusions!
The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees' conjuring turn
And we all say,
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees
COMPANY
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees
TUGGER
He is quiet, he is small, he is black
From the ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail
He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always deceiving you into believing
That he's only hunting for mice
He can play any trick with a cork
Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced
You have seen it one moment and then it's gone
But you find it next week lying on the lawn!
And we all say,
COMPANY
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever

MISOFFOLEES
My manner is vague and aloof
You would think there was nobody shyer
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire
And I've sometimes been heard by the fire
When I was about on the roof
At least they all heard that somebody purred
Which is incontestable proof of my singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call me in from the garden for hours
When I was asleep in the hall
TUGGER
And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

MEMORY
SILLABUB
Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses wither away
Like the sunflower I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day
MUNKUSTRAP
Now Old Deuteronomy, just before dawn
Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to a different Jellicle life
GRIZABELLA
Memory, turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
SILLABUB
Sunlight, through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
SILLABUB & GRIZABELLA
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
GRIZABELLA
The memory is fading
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun

Up up up up to the Heaviside layer
The mystical divinity of unashamed felinity
Round the cathedral rang 'Vivat'
Life to the everlasting cat!
THE AD足DRESSING OF CATS
DEUTERONOMY
You've heard of several kinds of cat
And my opinion now is that
You should need no interpreter to understand our character
You've learned enough to take the view
That cats are very much like you
You've seen us both at work and games
And learnt about our proper names
Our habits and habitat
But how would you ad足dress a cat?
COMPANY
So first, your memory I'll jog
And say: a cat is not a dog
DEUTERONOMY
With cats, some say, one rule is true
Don't speak 'til you are spoken to
Myself I do not hold with that
I say, you should ad足dress a cat
But always bear in mind that he resents familiarity
You bow, and taking off your hat, ad足dress him in this form: "O Cat!"
Before a cat will condescend
To treat you as a trusted friend
Some little token of esteem is needed, like a dish of cream
And you might now and then supply
Some caviar or Strasbourg pie
Some potted grouse or salmon paste
He's sure to have his personal taste
And so in time you reach your aim
And call him by his name
COMPANY
A cat's entitled to expect
These evidences of respect
So this is this and that is that
And there's how you ad足dress a cat
A cat's entitled to expect
These evidences of respect
So this is this and that is that
And there's how you ad足dress a cat
