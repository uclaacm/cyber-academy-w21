Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion,
carrot, leeks, garlic, salt, black pepper, and Aleppo pepper and
cook, stirring, until the onion becomes translucent, 8 to 10
minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into small pieces
with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Drain off the excess fat, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the pan.
Stir in the cornmeal. Add the stock, stirring, and bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Stir in the greens and cook for 15 minutes more, or
until tender. Ladle into bowls and garnish with grated Parmigiano.
